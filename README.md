Machine learning-based correction for computed NMR chemical shifts

Currently still under construction
----------------------------------

This repository contains the scripts used to correct NMR chemical shifts calculated with DFT toward CCSD(T) quality used in the original publication: https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.jctc.3c00165.

The scripts are preliminary and not in a user-friedly form and severe bugs are possible.

The given data set files are identical with those used in the publication and can be used to reproduce the results.
