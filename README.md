Machine learning-based correction for computed NMR chemical shifts

This repository contains the scripts used to correct NMR chemical shifts calculated with DFT toward CCSD(T) quality used in the original publication: https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.jctc.3c00165.

The given data set files are identical with those used in the publication and can be used to reproduce the results.

Currently still under construction
----------------------------------

The scripts found in this repository are not yet usable in a user-friendly way, but are already provided for completeness. Commented code and documentation will soon be provided in a first release. However, the code already does its job when executed with Python 3.7 and TensorFlow 2.7.
